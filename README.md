# About subl-settings

These are my [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) settings files.

## Installation Instructions

I'm making use of symlinks to point my Sublime settings to my actual dev folder
- to make it easier to configure this, I've based my Rakefile off of what I've
seen in many other dotfiles. To install, just run:

    rake install
